<p><i>Before you jump to Sweet And Sour Beef Chilli Dry With Garlic Rice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Make Healthy Eating A Part of Your Life</strong>.</i>
</br></p>
<p>The benefits of healthy eating are nowadays being given more publicity than ever before and there are good reasons for this. Poor diet is a contributing factor in health conditions such as heart disease and hypertension which can put a drain on the economy. There are more and more efforts to try to get us to lead a healthier way of living and yet it is also easier than ever to rely on fast, convenient food that is very bad for our health. Most people typically assume that healthy diets demand much work and will significantly change the way they live and eat. It is possible, however, to make a few simple changes that can start to make a good impact on our day-to-day eating habits.</p>
<p>One way to approach this to begin seeing some results is to realize that you do not have to alter everything straightaway or that you have to entirely get rid of certain foods from your diet. If you desire to commit to a wholesale change, that is okay but the main thing at first is to try to ensure that you are making more healthy eating choices. Soon enough, you will probably discover that you will eat more and more healthy food as your taste buds get used to the change. As with many other habits, change happens over a period of time and as soon as a new way of eating becomes part of who you are, you are not going to feel the need to return to your old diet.</p>
<p>Thus, it should be quite obvious that it&rsquo;s easy to add healthy eating to your daily lifestyle.</p>

<p>This popular Indian street food, is extremely appealing with spicy chilli flakes and dominant garlic flavours. After the beef has marinated, dust ½ cup of potato starch (or corn starch) on the beef and use your fingers to loosely coat the beef with it. We love easy homemade and restaurant-quality dishes like our famous Instant Pot Orange Chicken , Instant Pot Mongolian Chicken , and Instant Pot Beef and Broccoli. Heat a saucepan over medium-high heat and add rice, coconut milk, coconut water and salt. Stir, then bring to a boil.</p>
