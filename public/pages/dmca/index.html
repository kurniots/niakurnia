<p>Your physical or electronic signature, or a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on your behalf; Information reasonably sufficient to permit it to contact you or your authorized agent, including a name, address, telephone number and, if available, an email address; Identification of the Mark(s) alleged to have been infringed, including for registered Marks, a copy of each relevant federal trademark registration certificate or for common law or other Marks, evidence sufficient to establish your claimed rights in the Mark, including the nature of your use of the Mark, and the time period and geographic area in which the Mark has been used by you; Information reasonably sufficient to permit our Designated Copyright Agent to identify the use being challenged; A statement that you have not authorized the challenged use, and that you have a good-faith belief that the challenged use is not authorized by law; and A statement under penalty of perjury that all of the information in the notification is accurate and that you are the Mark owner, or are authorized to act on behalf of the Mark owner.</p>

If the registered user makes an appropriate showing of either (a), (b) or (c) then our Designated Copyright Agent may exercise its discretion not to remove the Mark.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, our Designated Copyright Agent will comply as appropriate with the terms of any court order relating to alleged trademark infringement on the Service.</p>

If the registered user succeeds in showing either (a), (b) or (c) then our Designated Copyright Agent may exercise its discretion not to remove the IP.</p>
<p>If our Designated Copyright Agent decides to comply with a takedown request, it will do so within a reasonably expeditious period of time.</p>
<p>We Have No Obligation to Adjudicate IP Claims – User’s Agreement to Hold Us Harmless From Claims</p>
